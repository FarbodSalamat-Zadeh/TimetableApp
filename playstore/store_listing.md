# Timetable - Student Planner

#### _The modern way to manage your student life!_

Timetable is the modern way to manage your student life!

Unlike paper planners, this app combines all aspects of student life in a beautifully designed and intuitive format.

Often late for lessons? Timetable reminds you of your classes X minutes before they start so you can always get to lessons on time.

Forgetful? Timetable allows you to view all of your assignments in one colorful list, also reminding you of incomplete assignments that you need to finish off. Once you're done, you can swipe them away to hide them from your list of things to-do.

Have more than one timetable? You may find that you've finished with one hard year of studies and want to start a new one, but don't want to delete your previous data. Timetable allows you to do just that - add different lessons, assignments and exams

There are many other features including: notifications for exams, optimized layouts for landscape phones and tablets, and much more.
